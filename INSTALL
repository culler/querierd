Installing querierd
=====================

This package contains two python scripts and some configuration files.
WARNING: These scripts require that the nemesis packet injection tool
be installed in /usr/local.  A separate package provides
nemesis. Install it first.

The script named querier is intended for use on systems (e.g. recent
Ubuntu systems) which use upstart.  It is simply a loop which sleeps
for a specified time interval and then sends an IGMP query packet to
the multicast broadcast address.  When started by upstart, the script
will be automatically "daemonized".

The other script, named querierd, is intended to function as a
standard sysv service script installed in /etc/init.d with appropriate
symlinks in the rc directories.  It is a daemon, which does a double
fork, and provides the usual start, stop and restart command line
options.  The daemon process runs a loop which sleeps for a specified
time interval and then sends an IGMP query packet.

Instructions
--------------

If your system uses upstart:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sudo cp querier /usr/local/bin
sudo cp etc/querierd /etc/querierd
sudo cp etc/init/querierd.conf /etc/init/querierd.conf

* Don't forget to check the permissions!

If your system uses traditional sysv scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sudo cp querierd /etc/init.d/querierd
sudo cp etc/querierd /etc/querierd

* Use your favorite method to create the appropriate symlinks in
  the rc directories.

* Don't forget to check the permissions!
